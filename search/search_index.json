Documentation: mkdocs.org . About me Hello! My name is Lebedev Sergey, i'm 36 years old. My hobby - Python became all my live now. Go to programming Most part i work in larges it progects in Russia (avito.ru, prom.ua, greeder.lv), but not as programmer. I was manager. Five years ago i began integrate crm (and erp) system Bitrix24 in companies. I began write code for integration bitrix24 and other system (sites, ip-tel, google-tables). And parsers. Many-many parsers. Requests and bs4 for simple sites. Selenium and bs4 for sites, were need js and what have protection from pars. Programming full time Last year i write program for company, that load orders on popular Bulletin boards. My experiens I have many experiens of understand, that wan't client and make it. Discuss projects and realize them. languages 1. Russian - 100% native language 2. English - 60% good technical eng (read books and articles about prog without dictionaries), but haven't speak practice 3. Ivrit - 1% several days ago i began learn it Examps of my projects 1. Program for load adds to avito.ru , tiu.ru , jazi.ru This is an internal program for the company. The program can: 1-1. Get xml of any subspecies from clients External Libreries : xml.etree.ElementTree,bs4,codecs,urllib.request 1-2. Automatically upload data to Google spreadsheets and change them automatically (recognition of categories, editing the name, description, cost and other parameters) External Libreries : google.oauth2, googleapiclient After realize module i understand, that google api have limit of querry. And later we make several api accaunts and switch between it. 1-3. Create xml tables of your own format from Google for each site External Libreries : pandas, gspread, gspread_dataframe 1-4. Generate and overlay text on the photo from product parameters on the fly External Libreries : cv2, numpy, PIL 1-5. Change the aspect ratio in the photo on the fly External Libreries : PIL 1-6. Overlay other pictures on the main photo on the fly External Libreries : PIL 1-7. Auto change background of image External Libreries : PIL, cv2 1-8. Load and read ftp. Different ftp for dif clients External Libreries : ftplib, io 1-9. Change size of photo and make collages from photo (\u0435o bypass blocking) External Libreries : PIL Summary This project mast be automat for 1 client. But became big program that help company work with hunders clients. the architecture of the code has changed continuously. Most of the tasks were done urgently. And there was no time to streamline the code. New developments have always been a priority. However, I managed to keep the code readable and maintainable for other developers, despite the fact that this was my first such a large and continuous project without allocating time for optimization. 2. Analysis of the issuance of avito.ru GitHub code I can show this code because I made it for myself This analize Avito by querry and write result in google sheet. It help make more effective adds in avito. External Libreries : openpyxl, requests, bs4, pandas, gspread, gspread_dataframe, fake_useragent 3. Parsers Many various parsers. Example you can see in \u21162 (Analysis avito). External Libreries : openpyxl, requests, bs4, pandas, gspread, gspread_dataframe, fake_useragent, selenium chrome and moziilla (if we need js and imitate ordinary user) 4. Telegram bot which allows you to respond to customers from message avito.ru In this project i use simple server flask and sqlite. Unfortunately, in my work, databases were very rarely needed, because Google Sheets was an ideal repository with the ability to edit data by users. This made it possible not to develop a separate interface for working with data. In this block i had big problems with avito api - avito make it recently and it not always work (this made testing very difficult). I met many mistakes, what not described in the documentation avito api. External Libreries : requests, json, flask, sqlite3, telethon (telegram client) Early, 2-3 years ago i make about several 10 bots for telegram with keyboards and useful functionality 5. API integration in Bitrix24 and Amocrm 5-1. And load data to google sheets, to make deeply customizable individual reports for business 5-2. Take all data to migrate in other crm/erp (usually from amo to b24) 5-3. Integrate with customs sites 5-4. Integrate with external api telephony (only info about calls, not calls) 5-5. Complex automations inside crm that are not available in standard functionality","title":"Home"},{"location":"#about-me","text":"Hello! My name is Lebedev Sergey, i'm 36 years old.
