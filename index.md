# <h1 align="center">**About me**</h1>
Hello! My name is Lebedev Sergey, i'm 36 years old.
My original hobby, Python, has become my whole life.
**Step to programming**
Most of my life i worked in the largest it-projects in Russia (avito.ru, prom.ua, greeder.lv), but not as programmer. I worked as a manager.
Five years ago i started integrating CRM (and ERP) systems [Bitrix24](https://www.bitrix24.ru){target=_blank} for companies.
As part of this activity, i started writing code to integrate Bitrix24 and other systems (sites, ip-tel, google-tables).
And parsers. Many different parsers. Requests and bs4 for simple sites. Selenium and bs4 for sites where js is needed and which have protection against parsing.
**My Tech Stack**
- python3
- flask
- sqlite
- numpy, pandas
- google sheets as database
**Full time Programming**
In the past year, i've been writing code for a company that uploads products to popular message boards.
**My strengths**
I have extensive experience in communicating with customers, describing business processes and automating them in crm or using code.
I love beautiful code. But i appreciate business needs to provide code fastly.
**languages**

**Russian** - native language
**English** - good technical Eng (reading books and notes on programming without a dictionary), but no speaking practice
**Ivrit** - a few days ago I started to study it

# <h1 align="center">**Examples of my projects**</h1>
<hr width="50%">
## 1. Program for load adds to [avito.ru](https://avito.ru){target=_blank}, [youla.ru](https://youla.ru/){target=_blank}, [jazi.ru](https://jazi.ru){target=_blank}
(Avito is bigest Russian marketplace focused on small resellers)
Features list:
1-1. Get xml of any subspecies from clients
1-2. Automatically upload data to Google Spreadsheets with data changes on the fly (recognition of categories, editing the name, description, cost and other parameters)
After realize module i understand, that google api have limit of querry. And later we make several api accaunts and switch between it.
1-3. Create xml tables of your own format from Google for each site
1-4. Generate and overlay text on the photo from product parameters on the fly
1-5. Change the aspect ratio in the photo on the fly
1-6. Overlay other pictures on the main photo on the fly
1-7. Auto change background of image
1-8. Load and read ftp. Different ftp for dif clients
1-9. Change size of photo and make collages from photo (еo bypass blocking)

**Summary**
This project was originally made as a small automation of one of my clients.
But it constantly grew. And now helps a company to work with hundreds of customers.
Architecture is constantly changing. And there was no time to bring it into perfect order.
Most of support tasks were really urgent.
And there was no time to streamline the code. New features and bug fixes have always been a priority.
However, I managed to keep the code readable and maintainable for other developers,
despite the fact that this was my first such a large and continuous project without allocating time for optimization.

## 2. Analysis of the issuance of [avito.ru](https://avito.ru){target=_blank}
[GitHub code](https://github.com/ezjikfrom/avito_analysis){target=_blank}
I can show this code because i made it for myself
It analizes Avito with queries and writes result in google sheet.
It helps to make more effective adds in avito.
**Technology stack**: openpyxl, requests, bs4, pandas, gspread, gspread_dataframe, fake_useragent
<hr width="50%">
## 3. Parsers
Many various parsers. Example you can see in №2 (Analysis avito).
**Technology stack**: openpyxl, requests, bs4, pandas, gspread, gspread_dataframe,
fake_useragent, selenium chrome and mozilla (if we need js and imitate ordinary user)
<hr width="50%">
## 4. Telegram bot which allows you to respond to customers from message [avito.ru](https://avito.ru){target=_blank}
In this project i use simple flask web server and sqlite database.
I used google sheets as database. It's stores data really well.
Also it provides really good data management UI.
So i did not need to develop it.

In this block i had big problems with avito api -
avito changed api recently and it does not always work. It alse makes testing really hard task.
I met many bugs, what not described in the documentation avito api.
**Technology stack**: requests, json, flask, sqlite3, telethon (telegram client)
Early, 2-3 years ago i make about several 10 bots for telegram with keyboards and useful functionality
<hr width="50%">
## 5. API integration in [Bitrix24](https://www.bitrix24.ru){target=_blank} and [Amocrm](https://www.amocrm.ru/){target=_blank}
5-1. And load data to google sheets, to make
deeply customizable individual reports for business
5-2. Take all data to migrate in other crm/erp (usually from amo to b24)
5-3. Integrate with customs sites
5-4. Integrate with external api telephony (only info about calls, not calls)
5-5. Complex automations inside crm that are not available in standard functionality
**Technology stack**: pandas, gspread, gspread_dataframe, requests, json
